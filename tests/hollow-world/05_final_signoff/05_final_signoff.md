# Final Signoff

PM reviews all completed work and pilot gives final signoff to close the project.

## Steps

1. PM reviews task tree — all tasks should be `completed`
2. PM verifies all artifacts exist:
   - `02_build_component_alpha/alpha.built`
   - `03_build_component_beta/beta.built`
   - `04_integration_check/integration.verified`
3. PM reports project readiness to pilot: `skd tell hwp "All tasks complete, ready for signoff"`
4. Pilot reviews roadmap status
5. Pilot marks final milestone complete
6. Pilot records signoff: create `05_final_signoff/signoff.md` with summary

## Acceptance Criteria

- All prior tasks in `completed` status
- All artifacts verified present
- Pilot has signed off
- Project roadmap shows all milestones complete
